Strategy and Program reviews with external facilitation are an effective catalyst for meaningful change:

- Is the Program delivering the benefits envisaged originally?
- Does the Program position the organisation well for the future?
- Has execution been managed effectively?
- How should future initiatives be ranked in order of priority?

Such a review agenda can help the organisation and the board of directors forge a common understanding of the situation, challenges, opportunities, and the economic facts. Thus it lays the groundwork for more effective strategic decision making. Here are some examples of our Program Reviews for clients:

- Evaluation of the operational fleet efficiency and network profitability for an international airline
- Business strategy review in consumer products industry
- Review of a $100m p.a. information technology outsourcing program for an energy utility
- Review of wine company - market, operations and financial performance - for financier, management and shareholder negotiations
- Review of asset management strategy and practice for mass transit operator
- Review of a major regional mineral supply chain for mine operators, rail and port operators, to identify the key bottlenecks and opportunities for increasing throughput.
