Our clients – large and small, private and public, for-profit and not-for-profit – are using operations research (O.R.) to unlock the value in their data, model complex systems, and make better decisions with less risk. 

Typically, O.R. projects target improved operating performance using data and analytics, for example to: 

1) improve coordination through better matching of supply with demand 
2) contain rising costs of production 
3) make better decisions about why, where, and how much to invest in operations
4) deal with peak capacity problems 
5) manage volatility in supply chains
6) add value to commodities by solving service and product quality issues; and 
7) manage risk in operations. 

Whether O.R. is used to inform high-level strategy or improve day-to-day operations, the results speak for themselves: Insight into difficult problems. Improved processes, productivity, and performance. Millions in cost savings and increased revenues. More (and better) options. Accurate predictions, plans, and forecasts. More profitable pricing. Greater market share. Higher quality. Superior ROI. More satisfied customers.
